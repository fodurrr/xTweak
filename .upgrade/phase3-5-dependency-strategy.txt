Phases 3-5: Dependency Update Strategy
======================================

## Current Status

### Phase 3: Phoenix & LiveView ✅ COMPLETE
- Phoenix: 1.8.1 (latest stable)
- Phoenix LiveView: 1.1.16 (latest)
- Phoenix HTML: 4.3.0 (latest)
- Phoenix Live Dashboard: 0.8.7 (latest)
- Phoenix Live Reload: 1.6.1 (latest)
**Action: NONE NEEDED - All up-to-date**

### Phase 4: Ash Framework ✅ COMPLETE
- ash: 3.7.6 (latest)
- ash_postgres: 2.6.23 (latest)
- ash_authentication: 4.12.0 (latest)
- ash_phoenix: 2.3.17 (latest)
**Action: NONE NEEDED - All up-to-date**

### Phase 5: Other Dependencies

#### Low-Risk Update (RECOMMENDED):
1. **ash_ai** (dev-only)
   - Current: 0.2.14
   - Target: 0.3.0
   - Risk: LOW (dev dependency, minor version)
   - Action: UPDATE

#### Medium-Risk Updates (INVESTIGATE):
2. **tailwind**
   - Current: 0.2.4
   - Target: 0.4.1
   - Jump: 0.2 → 0.4 (two minor versions)
   - Risk: MEDIUM (build tool, could affect CSS compilation)
   - Action: INVESTIGATE breaking changes, then decide

3. **gettext**
   - Current: 0.26.2
   - Target: 1.0.0
   - Jump: MAJOR version
   - Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH (i18n library, breaking changes expected)
   - Action: INVESTIGATE breaking changes, then decide

## Test Baseline (Before Updates)
✅ All tests passing: 14/14
- xtweak_docs: 2 tests
- xtweak_ui: 1 test
- xtweak_core: 9 tests (6 doctests + 3)
- xtweak_web: 2 tests

## Recommended Approach

### Conservative (RECOMMENDED for production):
1. Update ash_ai only (dev dependency, low risk)
2. Document gettext and tailwind as "deferred updates"
3. Plan separate upgrade cycles for gettext 1.0 and tailwind 0.4
4. Focus on Elixir 1.19.1 modernization and performance gains

### Aggressive (if time permits):
1. Update ash_ai
2. Research tailwind 0.2 → 0.4 breaking changes
3. If tailwind safe, update and test
4. Research gettext 1.0 breaking changes
5. If gettext safe, update and test

## Decision: CONSERVATIVE APPROACH

Rationale:
- Primary goal is Elixir 1.19.1 upgrade ✅ COMPLETE
- Phoenix already on latest ✅ COMPLETE
- Ash already on latest ✅ COMPLETE
- All tests passing ✅ COMPLETE
- Zero security vulnerabilities ✅ COMPLETE
- Gettext and tailwind updates can be separate initiatives
- Minimize risk by focusing on core platform upgrade

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ Update ash_ai: 0.2.14 → 0.3.0
2. ⏸️ Defer gettext: 0.26.2 → 1.0.0 (track for future)
3. ⏸️ Defer tailwind: 0.2.4 → 0.4.1 (track for future)

## Future Tracking
Create issues/tasks for:
- [ ] Investigate and upgrade gettext to 1.0.0
- [ ] Investigate and upgrade tailwind to 0.4.1
- [ ] Review any other "Update not possible" dependencies
