Phase 1: Pre-Flight Assessment Notes
======================================

Status: Blocked - Cannot run mix commands until Elixir version updated

Finding:
- Elixir 1.19.1 is installed locally
- All mix.exs files still require Elixir ~> 1.18.1
- Mix refuses to run: "You're trying to run XTweak.MixProject on Elixir v1.19.1 but it has declared in its mix.exs file it supports only Elixir ~> 1.18.1"

Action Required:
- Must proceed directly to Phase 2: Update all mix.exs version constraints
- Then return to complete Phase 1 audits

Deferred Commands (will run after Phase 2):
- mix hex.outdated > .upgrade/deps-before.txt
- mix deps.audit > .upgrade/audit-before.txt
- mix test > .upgrade/test-before.txt
- mix sobelow --root apps/xtweak_web --skip > .upgrade/sobelow-before.txt
