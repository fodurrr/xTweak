## Summary

This comprehensive plan provides a structured approach to achieving Claude agent parity in Codex CLI:

### Key Deliverables Provided:
1. **Phased Roadmap**: 4 phases over 15 days with clear objectives, tasks, success criteria, and risk mitigation
2. **Mapping Table**: Complete mapping of 21 Claude agents to Codex profiles with priority levels
3. **MCP Integration Strategy**: Server configuration, stdio proxy usage, example tool calls
4. **Minimal TOML Examples**: Base config with providers, MCP servers, and two sample profiles (`verify`, `review`)
5. **CLI Workflows**: Interactive and CI integration examples with practical scripts
6. **Verification Checklist**: Phase-by-phase validation steps and integration tests
7. **Rollback Plan**: Immediate, partial, and full rollback procedures with triggers

### Critical Success Factors:
- **MCP Connectivity**: All 4 servers (Tidewave, Ash AI, Context7, Playwright) must be accessible
- **Pattern Discipline**: Core pattern stack must be embedded in each profile
- **Tool Permissions**: Profiles must declare allowed tools matching Claude agents
- **Quality Gates**: Format, credo, compile, and test checks must be enforced

### Next Steps:
1. Start with Phase 1 infrastructure setup
2. Test MCP connectivity using provided health checks
3. Implement `verify` profile as proof of concept
4. Gradually migrate agents by priority (P0 → P1 → P2 → P3)
5. Validate multi-agent workflows match Claude behavior

The plan maintains reversibility at each phase and preserves the PLAN → CONTEXT → DIFFS → CHECKS → SUMMARY operating pattern that defines the Claude agent system.
