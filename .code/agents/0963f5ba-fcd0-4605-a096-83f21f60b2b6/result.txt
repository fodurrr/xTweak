Agent: Continue implementing the Codex CLI parity plan for the xTweak repository. We already added docs/codex_profiles.md with plan, mapping, MCP integration, minimal TOML, workflows, verification checklist, and rollback steps; AGENTS.md now links to that doc. Next steps: create actual Codex config snippet (e.g., scripts/codex/config.xtweak.toml template), ensure documentation references it, and integrate parity instructions into existing tooling so developers can enable xtweak profiles quickly. Review existing documentation (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) to keep conventions aligned. Aim to add sample TOML include file, validation scripts or make targets if useful, and update docs accordingly.

**Recognizing read-only environment constraints**

I’m locked in read-only mode (`sandbox_mode: read-only`, `approval_policy: never`), so I can’t add the Codex config template or update the docs myself. If you can switch me to a writable workspace (or apply the changes you’d like me to draft), I’ll jump on it right away—just let me know!
