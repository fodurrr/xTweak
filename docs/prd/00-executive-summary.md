## 🎯 Vision & Mission

### Vision
Establish **xTweak UI** as the premier component library for Phoenix/LiveView applications, bringing the polish and developer experience of Vue ecosystem (Nuxt UI) to the Elixir community.

### Mission
Port Nuxt UI's comprehensive component library (100+ components) to Phoenix/LiveView with:
- **Idiomatic Elixir patterns** (Phoenix.Component, LiveView assigns, HEEx templates)
- **Production-grade quality** (WCAG AA accessibility, comprehensive testing)
- **Familiar developer experience** for developers transitioning from Vue/React
- **Open-source contribution** to the Phoenix ecosystem via Hex.pm

---

## 💼 Business Case

### Problem Statement
Current Phoenix/LiveView ecosystem lacks a comprehensive, well-designed component library:

1. **Fragmented Solutions**: PetalComponents (limited scope), Surface UI (different philosophy), no comprehensive option
2. **Reinventing the Wheel**: Teams build the same components repeatedly (forms, modals, dropdowns)
3. **Accessibility Gaps**: Few libraries prioritize WCAG compliance out-of-the-box
4. **Design System Absence**: No standardized theming approach for Phoenix apps
5. **Vue Developer Gap**: Developers familiar with Nuxt UI lack equivalent in Phoenix ecosystem

### Opportunity
- **Growing Phoenix/LiveView Adoption**: LiveView 1.0+ momentum in 2025
- **Vue Developer Migration**: Developers familiar with Nuxt UI seeking similar DX in Elixir
- **Enterprise Demand**: Need for production-ready, accessible UI components
- **Community Contribution**: Strengthen Elixir ecosystem with high-quality tooling

### Value Proposition

| Stakeholder | Value Delivered |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Phoenix Developers** | 100+ production-ready components, faster feature development, consistent UX |
| **Product Teams** | Reduced development time (30-50% for UI-heavy features), lower maintenance |
| **xTweak Project** | Reusable foundation for internal apps, showcase of technical capability |
| **Elixir Community** | High-quality open-source tool, lowers barrier to entry for new Phoenix developers |

## 📚 Appendices

### A. Competitive Analysis

| Library | Phoenix Native | Component Count | Accessibility | Theming | Maintenance |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| **PetalComponents** | ✅ Yes | ~30 | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Tailwind | 🟢 Active |
| **Surface UI** | ⚠️ Macro-based | ~40 | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Custom | 🟡 Moderate |
| **xTweak UI** (Target) | ✅ Yes | **100+** | ✅ WCAG AA | ✅ Nuxt UI-style | 🟢 Planned |

**Unique Value**: First Phoenix library with comprehensive Nuxt UI-inspired API and theming system.

### B. Technology Comparison: Tailwind vs UnoCSS

| Criteria | Tailwind CSS | UnoCSS | Decision |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Performance** | Good (JIT) | Excellent (5x faster) | Phase 3 evaluation |
| **Phoenix Integration** | ✅ Proven | ⚠️ Experimental | Start with Tailwind |
| **Ecosystem** | Huge | Growing | Tailwind safer for v1.0 |
| **Bundle Size** | ~50KB | ~30KB | UnoCSS advantage |
| **Flexibility** | Excellent | Excellent | Both suitable |

**Recommendation**: Start with Tailwind CSS (proven Phoenix integration), evaluate UnoCSS in Phase 3 with 3 component POC.

### C. Component Prioritization Framework

Components prioritized by:
1. **Usage Frequency**: How often needed in typical Phoenix apps
2. **Complexity**: Simple components first (Button, Badge) → Complex (CommandPalette, DatePicker)
3. **Dependencies**: Components with no deps before those requiring JS hooks
4. **MVP Necessity**: Core forms, navigation, feedback before advanced data viz

**Phase 2 MVP List** (20 components):
- Forms: Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Radio, FormGroup (6)
- Navigation: Button, Link, Dropdown, Tabs, Breadcrumb (5)
- Feedback: Alert, Modal, Toast, Tooltip, Progress (5)
- Layout: Card, Badge, Avatar, Divider (4)
