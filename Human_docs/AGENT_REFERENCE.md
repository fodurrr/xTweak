# Agent Reference Guide - FOR PETER (HUMAN USER)

> **AUDIENCE**: This document is for **Peter (the human user)**, NOT for the coordinator or subagents.
>
> **Three-Layer Architecture**:
> 1. **Peter (User)** - You, the human. This doc is for you.
> 2. **Base Claude (Coordinator)** - Reads `CLAUDE.md` for routing protocol
> 3. **Subagents** - Read their frontmatter (`model:`, `pattern-stack:`, `required-usage-rules:`)
>
> **When to use this doc**: Reference agent capabilities, understand model selection strategy, or review common workflow patterns.

## Model Selection Philosophy

xTweak uses a **cost-optimized model selection strategy**:

### ‚ö° Haiku 4.5 (Cost-Optimized)
**Use for**: Bounded implementation tasks with clear patterns
- ~90% cheaper than Sonnet
- Fast for structured, well-defined work
- Auto-escalates to Sonnet when needed

**6 Haiku Agents**:
- `mcp-verify-first` - Context gathering with MCP tools
- `docs-maintainer` - Markdown/changelog editing
- `code-review-implement` - Applying documented review feedback
- `database-migration-specialist` - Schema-focused SQL migration generation
- `pattern-librarian` - Pattern compliance auditing
- `monitoring-setup` - Configuration-focused telemetry setup

### üß† Sonnet 4.5 (Quality-Focused)
**Use for**: Analysis, judgment, coordination, complex reasoning
- Baseline quality model
- All complex decision-making
- 18 Sonnet agents (all others)

### Escalation Strategy
**When Haiku escalates** (look for `‚ö†Ô∏è HAIKU ESCALATION RECOMMENDED`):
- Compile errors
- Test failures
- MCP tool failures
- Pattern violations
- Uncertain outcomes

**Target escalation rate**: <10% (1 in 10 Haiku executions requires Sonnet retry)

## Common Multi-Agent Workflows

### Code Quality Pipeline
**Sequence**: `mcp-verify-first` ‚Üí `code-reviewer` ‚Üí `code-review-implement` ‚Üí `code-reviewer`

**Use when**: You want to audit and improve code quality
- Separates diagnosis from execution
- Captures score deltas between reviews
- Logs commands and remaining todos

### Frontend Delivery
**Sequence**: `mcp-verify-first` ‚Üí (optional `ash-resource-architect`) ‚Üí `nuxt-ui-expert` (research) ‚Üí `frontend-design-enforcer` ‚Üí `heex-template-expert` / `tailwind-strategist` ‚Üí `test-builder`

**Use when**: Building UI features
- Research phase: Component specs
- Coordination phase: Integration strategy
- Implementation phase: Code generation
- Use Playwright for screenshots/accessibility

### Backend Resource Development
**Sequence**: `mcp-verify-first` ‚Üí `ash-resource-architect` ‚Üí `test-builder` ‚Üí `code-reviewer`

**Use when**: Creating or modifying Ash resources
- Always generate migrations + tests before handoff
- Document policies, calculations, pending follow-ups

### Bug Fix / Incident Response
**Sequence**: `mcp-verify-first` ‚Üí `test-builder` (reproduce + tests) ‚Üí Domain agent ‚Üí `code-reviewer` ‚Üí `security-reviewer` (if exploit)

**Use when**: Something's broken
- Reproduce first with tests
- Document root cause + remediation steps
- Use error-recovery-loop pattern

### Release Readiness
**Sequence**: `mcp-verify-first` ‚Üí `dependency-auditor` ‚Üí `test-builder` ‚Üí `release-coordinator` ‚Üí `docs-maintainer`

**Use when**: Preparing for release
- Dependency checks run first
- Release coordinator blocks completion without proof
- Documentation finalized last

### Security Sweep
**Sequence**: `mcp-verify-first` ‚Üí `security-reviewer` ‚Üí Owners (`code-review-implement`) ‚Üí `security-reviewer` (verification)

**Use when**: Auditing for vulnerabilities
- Only findings with confidence ‚â•8/10
- Track mitigation status via TodoWrite

## Slash Commands Quick Reference

### PRD-Centric Commands (Feature Development)
- `/prd-plan-sprint` - Plan next sprint from PRD roadmap
- `/prd-implement` - Execute current sprint tasks
- `/prd-status` - Dashboard of progress
- `/prd-continue` - Resume where you left off
- `/prd-update [section]` - Update specific PRD chapter

### Non-PRD Commands (Maintenance & Quality)
- `/fix-bug "description"` - Emergency bug fixes, hotfixes
- `/refactor [operation] [target]` - Code quality improvements
- `/upgrade-deps [package]` - Dependency upgrades
- `/update-docs [type]` - Non-PRD documentation
- `/setup-tool [type] [name]` - Infrastructure & tooling
- `/workflow [action] [target]` - Workflow infrastructure management

**Key Principle**: PRD commands track long-term project goals. Non-PRD commands handle reactive work, maintenance, and infrastructure.

## When to Launch Agents Directly vs. Slash Commands

| Your Request | Best Approach | Why |
|--------------|---------------|-----|
| "Fix the login bug" | `/fix-bug "login bug"` | Structured workflow with test-first approach |
| "Add email field to User" | Direct: `ash-resource-architect` | Simple, single-agent task |
| "Refactor Badge component" | `/refactor extract Badge` | Ensures review ‚Üí implement ‚Üí test sequence |
| "Continue working on sprint" | `/prd-continue` | Checks PRD status, resumes tasks |
| "Review this file" | Direct: `code-reviewer` | Single-agent, single-file audit |
| "Upgrade Ash to 3.8" | `/upgrade-deps ash` | Complex workflow with safety checks |

## How Information Flows (Three-Layer Architecture)

```
Peter (You)
    ‚Üì [Give prompt]
Base Claude (Coordinator)
    ‚Üì [Read CLAUDE.md]
    ‚Üì [Classify request type]
    ‚Üì [Select agent from matrix above]
    ‚Üì [Launch via Task tool with context]
Subagent (e.g., ash-resource-architect)
    ‚Üì [Read own frontmatter: model, pattern-stack, required-usage-rules]
    ‚Üì [Receive context from coordinator]
    ‚Üì [Execute task]
    ‚Üì [Return results via collaboration-handoff]
Base Claude (Coordinator)
    ‚Üì [Synthesize results]
    ‚Üì [Present to Peter]
Peter (You)
    ‚Üì [Review results, provide feedback]
```

**Key Points**:
- **Peter (you)**: Only interact with the coordinator
- **Coordinator**: Routes everything, doesn't implement
- **Subagents**: Self-contained, receive context from coordinator
- **No circular references**: Each layer knows only what it needs

---

## Quality Gates (Always Run These)

```bash
mix format                           # Format code
mix credo --strict                   # Linting
mix compile --warnings-as-errors     # Compilation
mix test apps/xtweak_core/test/...   # Targeted tests
```

All agents should run these before completing work.
