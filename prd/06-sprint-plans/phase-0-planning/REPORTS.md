**Key Changes**:
- Updated agent documentation with MCP tool references
- Added usage rules integration section
- Clarified automatic rule discovery via Ash AI MCP server

**Outcome**:
- Documentation synchronized with new MCP approach
- Agent workflows updated
- Usage rules system documented

---

### Docs Maintainer: Elixir Upgrade Audit (2025-10-29)
**Agent**: `docs-maintainer`
**Purpose**: Document Elixir/OTP version upgrade and validate compatibility
**File**: Originally `.claude/agent-reports/2025-10-29-docs-maintainer-elixir-upgrade-audit.md`

**Summary**:
- Documented upgrade to Elixir 1.19.1 + Erlang OTP 28
- Verified compatibility with all dependencies
- Updated documentation to reflect new versions

**Key Changes**:
- Updated version references across docs
- Verified all tooling compatible
- Noted Nix flake configuration

**Outcome**:
- Elixir/OTP upgrade documented
- No compatibility issues found
- Development environment stable

---

### Pattern Audit (2025-10-30)
**Agent**: `pattern-librarian`
**Purpose**: Audit pattern library for compliance and versioning
**File**: Originally `.claude/agent-reports/pattern-audit-2025-10-30.md`

**Summary**:
- Audited all patterns in `.claude/patterns/`
- Verified version metadata
- Checked agent pattern-stack references

**Key Findings**:
- 10 patterns defined and documented
- All patterns have version metadata
- Core pattern stack properly referenced

**Issues Found**:
- None - all patterns compliant

**Recommendations**:
- Continue maintaining version discipline
- Update CHANGELOG.md when patterns change

---

### Pattern Audit Summary (2025-10-30)
**Agent**: `pattern-librarian`
**Purpose**: Summary audit of entire pattern system
**File**: Originally `.claude/agent-reports/PATTERN-AUDIT-SUMMARY-2025-10-30.md`

**Summary**:
- Comprehensive audit of pattern system
- Validated consistency across all agents
- Checked pattern versioning discipline

**Key Metrics**:
- 10 patterns total
- 24 agents referencing patterns
- 100% compliance with pattern-stack requirements
- Version consistency maintained

**Recommendations**:
- Pattern system healthy
- Continue current maintenance practices
- Consider pattern library guide (completed)

---

### Documentation Review (2025-10-30)
**Agent**: `docs-maintainer`
**Purpose**: Review documentation after refactoring
**File**: Originally `.claude/agent-reports/docs-review-2025-10-30.md`

**Summary**:
- Reviewed documentation structure post-refactor
- Validated AI_docs/ and Human_docs/ separation
- Checked cross-references and navigation

**Key Findings**:
- Clear separation achieved
- Navigation improved
- Some redundancy still exists (addressed in later refactor)

**Actions Taken**:
- Noted areas for future consolidation
- Validated documentation accuracy
