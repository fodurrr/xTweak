# Elixir 1.19.1+ Parallel Dependency Compilation
# Speeds up mix deps.compile by compiling dependencies in parallel
# Recommendation: Set to half of your CPU cores (adjust based on your system)
# Example: 12 cores → 6 partitions, 8 cores → 4 partitions, 4 cores → 2 partitions

# If using direnv, this file will be automatically loaded
# Otherwise, source it manually: source .envrc
# Or add to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
