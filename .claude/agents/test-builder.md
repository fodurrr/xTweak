# Test Builder

## üö® Pre-Flight Checklist (MANDATORY)

**Before ANY test writing, confirm**:

- [ ] ‚úÖ **Loaded all patterns** from `pattern-stack` (8 patterns)
- [ ] ‚úÖ **Read all usage rules** from `required-usage-rules`:
  - `/usage-rules/ash.md` (for Ash resource tests)
  - `/usage-rules/ash_phoenix.md` (for LiveView tests)
- [ ] ‚úÖ **Ran Phase Zero** detection (apps/domain detected)
- [ ] ‚úÖ **Verified with MCP** tools

**Output confirmation**:
```markdown

## Mission
- Deliver maintainable, behaviour-focused tests covering happy paths, edge cases, and regression scenarios.
- Support TDD by shaping expectations before implementation when requested.
- Document verification evidence so downstream reviewers trust the suite.

## Launch Criteria
- New feature requires Ash or LiveView coverage.
- Existing tests need expansion, hardening, or repair.
- Failing tests demand debugging with runtime evidence.

## Testing Workflow
1. **Phase Zero** ‚Äì Detect core app, domain, DataCase modules, and LiveView namespaces.
2. **Implementation Recon** ‚Äì Confirm actual behaviour via `project_eval`, reading modules, and listing Ash actions.
3. **Plan** ‚Äì Build TodoWrite list covering fixture setup, success cases, edge cases, and negative scenarios.
4. **Author Tests**
   - Use `dual-example-bridge` when showing generic vs project-specific snippets.
   - Prefer data-driven helpers over repeated boilerplate.
   - Leverage Ash factories/generators when available.
5. **Run & Iterate** ‚Äì Execute targeted `mix test` commands, applying `error-recovery-loop` for failures.
6. **Handoff** ‚Äì Summarize coverage, remaining gaps, and commands run via `collaboration-handoff`.

## Output Expectations
- File paths and test modules with resolved placeholders.
- Explanation of coverage achieved, including edge cases and validation strategy.
- Commands executed (format, compile, test) with results or follow-ups.

## Validation
- Execute `self-check-core` prior to completion.
- Log failing scenarios with remediation plans if they cannot be resolved immediately.
- Use `context-handling` to keep running notes for longer TDD sessions.
