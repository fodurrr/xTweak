## Cross-Reference Verification

### Internal Links Verified

- ✅ `AGENTS.md` → `docs/codex_profiles.md` (full profile matrix)
- ✅ `AGENTS.md` → `scripts/codex/MIGRATION.md` (migration details)
- ✅ `AGENTS.md` → `dev_docs/codex_mcp_troubleshooting.md` (troubleshooting)
- ✅ `docs/codex_profiles.md` → `scripts/codex/MIGRATION.md` (migration reference)
- ✅ `scripts/codex/MIGRATION.md` → `dev_docs/codex_mcp_troubleshooting.md` (troubleshooting)

### References to Proxy Scripts

All references to proxy scripts are properly contextualized:
- **Rollback sections only**: MIGRATION.md, troubleshooting.md (appropriate)
- **Archive references**: AGENTS.md mentions archived scripts (appropriate)
- **No active usage**: No docs recommend using proxies for new setups ✅

### Configuration Consistency

All configuration examples are consistent:
- ✅ `experimental_use_rmcp_client = true` flag present
- ✅ TideWave URL: `http://127.0.0.1:4000/tidewave/mcp`
- ✅ AshAI URL: `http://127.0.0.1:4000/ash_ai/mcp`
- ✅ Context7: `npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp`
- ✅ Playwright: `npx @playwright/mcp`

## Markdown Formatting Review

### Code Blocks
- ✅ All TOML blocks properly fenced with \`\`\`toml
- ✅ All bash commands properly fenced with \`\`\`bash
- ✅ Inline code uses backticks appropriately

### Structure
- ✅ Proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- ✅ Consistent list formatting
- ✅ Tables properly formatted where used
- ✅ No broken markdown detected

### Consistency
- ✅ Consistent terminology ("native HTTP", "MCP servers", "stdio-based")
- ✅ Consistent command formatting
- ✅ Consistent file path references

## Validation Commands Tested

```bash
# Verified these commands work as documented
codex mcp list                 # ✅ Shows all 4 servers
codex mcp get tidewave        # ✅ Shows streamable_http transport
codex mcp get ash_ai          # ✅ Shows streamable_http transport

# Configuration validation
bash scripts/codex/validate.sh  # ✅ Passes all checks

# Archive verification
ls -la scripts/mcp/archive/    # ✅ All 3 .bak files present
```

## Changes Applied During Review

### 1. AGENTS.md - Complete Rewrite of MCP Section
**Before**: Detailed proxy script setup with multiple configuration variations
**After**: Clean native HTTP configuration with references to comprehensive guides

**Rationale**:
- Simplified primary team reference document
- Moved complexity to specialized guides
- Clear "recommended" approach (native HTTP)
- Better cross-references to detailed docs

**Impact**: Team members now see native HTTP as the default, with one clear path forward

### 2. .claude/CHANGELOG.md - Added Migration Entry
**Added**: Detailed entry for October 28, 2025 with all changed files and benefits

**Rationale**: Maintains historical record of significant infrastructure changes

**Impact**: Future reference for why migration happened and what changed

## Outstanding Documentation Considerations

### None Found
All documentation is complete and accurate. No additional documentation required at this time.

### Future Recommendations

1. **After 1 Week**: If no rollback needed, consider removing proxy scripts entirely:
   ```bash
   rm -rf scripts/mcp/archive/
   ```
   Then update `.gitignore` and MIGRATION.md to reflect permanent removal.

2. **After 1 Month**: Add "success story" note to MIGRATION.md showing real-world usage statistics:
   - Number of developers using native HTTP
   - Any issues encountered and resolved
   - Performance improvements observed

3. **For Next Version**: Consider updating `CLAUDE.md` to explicitly mention Codex CLI version requirement (0.50+) in Project Snapshot section.

## Team Handoff Summary

### What Was Done
✅ Reviewed 5 primary documentation files for accuracy
✅ Verified 3 configuration files match native HTTP setup
✅ Confirmed 3 proxy scripts properly archived
✅ Updated AGENTS.md with clean native HTTP configuration
✅ Added changelog entry documenting the migration
✅ Verified all cross-references and internal links
✅ Validated markdown formatting throughout
✅ Tested all documented validation commands

### What Developers Should Know

**For New Developers**:
- Start with `AGENTS.md` → "MCP Setup for Codex CLI" section
- Follow minimal configuration example
- Run `codex mcp list` to verify
- Reference `dev_docs/codex_mcp_troubleshooting.md` if issues arise

**For Existing Developers**:
- Read `scripts/codex/MIGRATION.md` for complete migration steps
- Update global config: `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Regenerate project config: `bash scripts/codex/setup.sh`
- Validate: `bash scripts/codex/validate.sh`
- Test: `codex mcp list` should show HTTP transport for TideWave/AshAI

**For Troubleshooting**:
1. Check Phoenix server is running: `mix phx.server`
2. Verify config flag: `experimental_use_rmcp_client = true`
3. Test endpoints with curl (examples in troubleshooting.md)
4. Rollback procedure available if needed (MIGRATION.md)

### Migration Status

| Component | Status | Transport | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| TideWave | ✅ Migrated | streamable_http | Native HTTP working |
| AshAI | ✅ Migrated | streamable_http | Native HTTP working |
| Context7 | ✅ Unchanged | stdio | npx-based, no changes |
| Playwright | ✅ Unchanged | stdio | npx-based, no changes |

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Done)
✅ Documentation review complete
✅ All files updated and consistent
✅ Changelog entry added
✅ Cross-references verified

### Short-Term (Optional)
- Monitor for any team questions or confusion (first week)

### Long-Term (Recommended)
- After 1 week of stable operation: Consider removing archived proxy scripts
- After 1 month: Add usage statistics and success metrics to MIGRATION.md
- Next quarter: Review if any additional MCP servers should migrate to native HTTP
