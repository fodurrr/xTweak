# Agent Reports

This directory contains reports generated by Claude Code agents during their execution. These reports provide detailed analysis, findings, and recommendations for various project operations.

## Purpose

Agent reports serve as:
- **Audit Trail:** Historical record of agent activities and decisions
- **Documentation:** Detailed analysis and findings for team review
- **Knowledge Base:** Reference material for future similar tasks
- **Compliance:** Evidence of due diligence for security/quality processes

## Report Types

Reports are organized by agent type. Common agent reports include:

### dependency-auditor
- Dependency upgrade plans and execution reports
- Security vulnerability assessments
- Breaking change analysis
- Compatibility reports

### code-reviewer
- Code review findings and recommendations
- Security vulnerability analysis
- Code quality assessments
- Best practice violations

### security-reviewer
- Security audit reports
- Vulnerability assessments
- Compliance checks
- Risk analysis

### test-builder
- Test coverage reports
- Test generation summaries
- Quality metrics

### performance-profiler
- Performance analysis reports
- Bottleneck identification
- Optimization recommendations

### release-coordinator
- Release summaries
- Deployment checklists
- Rollback procedures

## Naming Convention

Reports follow this naming pattern:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-{agent-type}-{brief-description}.md
```

**Examples:**
- `2025-10-27-dependency-auditor-phased-upgrade.md`
- `2025-10-28-code-reviewer-newsletter-policies.md`
- `2025-10-29-security-reviewer-auth-audit.md`
- `2025-11-01-test-builder-coverage-report.md`

## Report Format

All reports should include:

1. **Header Section**
   - Date and timestamp
   - Agent type
   - Project context
   - Execution mode/status

2. **Executive Summary**
   - Key findings
   - Critical issues
   - Action items

3. **Detailed Analysis**
   - Phase-by-phase breakdown
   - Evidence and data
   - File references with line numbers

4. **Test Results**
   - Validation performed
   - Pass/fail status
   - Regression analysis

5. **Recommendations**
   - Immediate actions
   - Future work
   - Best practices

6. **Metadata**
   - Agent version

## Git Management

### Should Reports Be Committed?

**YES - Recommended for:**
- Dependency audits (historical tracking)
- Security reviews (compliance)
- Release reports (documentation)
- Major refactoring analysis

**NO - Consider .gitignore for:**
- Frequent automated reports
- Temporary analysis reports
- Personal development notes
- Large performance profiling data

**Current Policy:** Commit all reports by default unless they contain sensitive data or are purely temporary.

## Retention Policy

- **Keep indefinitely:** Security audits, major upgrades, release reports
- **Review annually:** Code reviews, test reports
- **Archive after 6 months:** Performance profiles, temporary analysis

## Integration with Other Documentation

Agent reports complement other project documentation:

- **`.claude/patterns/`** - Reusable patterns and guidelines
- **`.claude/agents/`** - Agent configurations and workflows
- **`docs/`** - User-facing documentation
- **Agent Reports** - Execution history and detailed findings

## Access and Review

### Who Should Read These Reports?

- **Development Team:** All reports for context and learning
- **Team Leads:** Executive summaries and action items
- **Security Team:** Security and dependency audit reports
- **QA Team:** Test and quality reports
- **DevOps:** Deployment and release reports

### When to Review

- **Before major changes:** Review similar past reports
- **During code review:** Check for related agent findings
- **During retrospectives:** Learn from past agent recommendations
- **During audits:** Provide evidence of due diligence
