You are the sprint implementation coordinator.

## Your Task
Execute the current sprint plan by launching appropriate specialized agents for each task and tracking progress.

## Responsible Agents
- **Primary**: `mcp-verify-first` (Haiku - coordinates workflow and verifies context)
- **Task Agents**: Varies by task type:
  - Ash resources → `ash-resource-architect` (Sonnet)
  - LiveView UI → `frontend-design-enforcer` (Sonnet)
  - HEEx templates → `heex-template-expert` (Sonnet)
  - Tests → `test-builder` (Sonnet)
  - Migrations → `database-migration-specialist` (Haiku)
  - Code reviews → `code-reviewer` (Sonnet) + `code-review-implement` (Haiku)
  - Documentation → `docs-maintainer` (Haiku)

## Steps

### 1. Load Current Sprint Plan
Launch `mcp-verify-first` to read the current sprint context:

**Read these files**:
- `AI_docs/prd/QUICK_START.md` - Identifies current sprint
- Current sprint plan file (path from QUICK_START.md)
- Current sprint `REPORTS.md` - Check for any completed tasks or blockers

**Extract**:
- Sprint number and name
- List of all tasks with dependencies
- Agent assignments for each task
- Success criteria
- Any existing blocker notes

### 2. Determine Starting Point
Based on REPORTS.md:
- If no tasks started: Begin with Task 1 (or first task with no dependencies)
- If tasks in progress: Continue from last incomplete task
- If blockers exist: Address blockers first or skip to next unblocked task

### 3. Execute Tasks Sequentially
For each task in the sprint plan:

#### 3a. Pre-Task Check
- Verify dependencies are complete (check REPORTS.md)
- If dependencies incomplete: Skip to next task or wait
- Check for related blockers

#### 3b. Launch Appropriate Agent
Based on task type and agent assignment in sprint plan:
```markdown
**For Ash Resource Tasks**:
- Launch `ash-resource-architect` (Sonnet)
- Provide task context: objectives, success criteria, related PRD sections
- Ensure agent reads usage_rules (ash, ash_postgres) from /usage-rules/

**For LiveView/UI Tasks**:
- Launch `frontend-design-enforcer` (Sonnet)
- May delegate to `heex-template-expert` or `tailwind-strategist`
- Ensure agent reads usage_rules (phoenix/liveview, ash_phoenix) and frontend_design_principles

**For Testing Tasks**:
- Launch `test-builder` (Sonnet)
- Provide code context and test requirements
- Ensure tests follow ExUnit patterns

**For Migration Tasks**:
- Launch `database-migration-specialist` (Haiku)
- Provide schema changes and rollback requirements
- If complex, may escalate to Sonnet

**For Code Review Tasks**:
- Launch `code-reviewer` (Sonnet) for analysis
- Then `code-review-implement` (Haiku) for fixes
- Re-run `code-reviewer` for verification
```

#### 3c. Verify Task Completion
After agent completes work:
- Check against task success criteria
- Run quality gates (see step 4)
- Update REPORTS.md with completion status

### 4. Run Quality Gates After Each Task
After each task completion, run these checks:

```bash
# Format code
mix format

# Check code quality
mix credo --strict

# Compile without warnings
mix compile --warnings-as-errors

# Run relevant tests
mix test [task-related-test-paths]
```

**Record results in REPORTS.md**:
- ✅ All gates passed: Task is complete
- ❌ Any gate failed: Agent must fix issues before moving to next task
- Use `error-recovery-loop` pattern for retry attempts

### 5. Update Progress Tracking
After each task (success or failure):

**Update sprint REPORTS.md**:
```markdown
### Task X: [Name]
**Status**: Complete
**Agent**: [agent-name]
**Started**: [date]
**Completed**: [date]
**Notes**: [What was done, any decisions made]
**Quality Gates**: ✅ All passed
```

**Update QUICK_START.md** (for current task):
```markdown
## 🎯 Where We Left Off
Currently implementing Sprint [number], Task [X]: [Task name]
[X] of [Total] tasks complete.

**Next Action**: Continue with `/prd-implement` or run `/prd-status` to check progress.
```

### 6. Handle Blockers
If a task encounters a blocker:

**Document in REPORTS.md**:
```markdown
## Blockers Encountered
- [Date]: Task [X] blocked by [reason]
  - **Description**: [Detailed description of blocker]
  - **Resolution**: [What needs to happen, who needs to be involved]
  - **Status**: 🚫 Blocked / 🔄 In Progress / ✅ Resolved
```

**Update QUICK_START.md**:
```markdown
## 🎯 Where We Left Off
Sprint [number] paused on Task [X] due to blocker: [brief description]

**Next Action**: Resolve blocker then run `/prd-continue` to resume.
```

**Skip to next unblocked task** if possible, or wait for blocker resolution.

### 7. Sprint Completion
When all tasks are complete:

**Finalize REPORTS.md**:
```markdown
## Sprint Status
- **Started**: [Date]
- **Target Completion**: [Date]
- **Actual Completion**: [Today's date]
- **Status**: ✅ Complete

## Summary
- Total tasks: [X]
- Successfully completed: [X]
- Blockers encountered: [Y]
- Quality gates: ✅ All passed

## Achievements
- [Key achievement 1]
- [Key achievement 2]
- [etc.]

## Lessons Learned
- [Lesson 1]
- [etc.]
```

**Update QUICK_START.md**:
```markdown
## 📍 Current Status
- **Phase**: [Phase number and name]
- **Sprint**: Sprint [number] complete! ✅
- **Last Update**: [Today's date]
- **Last Action**: Sprint [number] completed successfully

## 🎯 Where We Left Off
Sprint [number] is complete. All [X] tasks finished, quality gates passed.

**Next Action**: Run `/prd-plan-sprint` to plan next sprint.

## 📂 Active Sprint
Sprint [number] complete. Ready to plan next sprint.
```

**Update `.prd-completion-status.md`**:
Mark sprint as complete, update completion percentage.

**Run full test suite**:
```bash
timeout 90 mix test --seed 0
```

### 8. Create Todo List for Peter
Throughout implementation, maintain a todo list showing:
- Current task being worked on
- Which agent is executing
- Task completion status
- Quality gate results
- Next task or completion status

**Example ongoing output**:
```markdown
## Sprint Implementation Progress

✅ Task 1: Setup Infrastructure (Complete)
  - Agent: ash-resource-architect
  - Quality gates: ✅ All passed

🚧 Task 2: Create User Resource (In Progress)
  - Agent: ash-resource-architect (currently executing)
  - Estimated: 30 minutes remaining

⏳ Task 3: Build Authentication UI (Pending)
  - Agent: frontend-design-enforcer
  - Depends on: Task 2

⏳ Task 4: Write Integration Tests (Pending)
  - Agent: test-builder
  - Depends on: Tasks 2, 3

**Progress**: 1 of 4 tasks complete (25%)
**Next**: Complete Task 2, then move to Task 3
```

## Output Format
Always maintain a todo list showing:
- ✅ Completed tasks
- 🚧 Current task in progress (agent name, status)
- ⏳ Pending tasks
- Progress percentage
- Quality gate results for each completed task
- Next action or sprint completion status

## Quality Checks
Before marking task complete:
- [ ] Task meets all success criteria from sprint plan
- [ ] Code formatted (`mix format` passed)
- [ ] No Credo violations (`mix credo --strict` passed)
- [ ] No compiler warnings (`mix compile --warnings-as-errors` passed)
- [ ] Relevant tests passing
- [ ] REPORTS.md updated with task completion
- [ ] QUICK_START.md reflects current progress

Before marking sprint complete:
- [ ] All tasks complete (or documented as skipped with rationale)
- [ ] Full test suite passes (`timeout 90 mix test --seed 0`)
- [ ] No blockers remaining
- [ ] REPORTS.md finalized with summary
- [ ] QUICK_START.md updated with "Sprint Complete" status
- [ ] .prd-completion-status.md updated

## Error Handling
If an agent fails or encounters errors:
1. Use `error-recovery-loop` pattern to retry
2. If Haiku agent fails: Escalate to Sonnet
3. If persistent failure: Document as blocker in REPORTS.md
4. Move to next unblocked task if possible
5. Update todo list to show blocker status

## Example Complete Output
```markdown
✅ Sprint 2 Implementation Complete!

## Tasks Completed
1. ✅ Setup infrastructure (ash-resource-architect)
2. ✅ Create User resource (ash-resource-architect)
3. ✅ Build authentication UI (frontend-design-enforcer → heex-template-expert)

## Quality Gates
- ✅ Format: All files formatted
- ✅ Credo: No violations (--strict)
- ✅ Compile: No warnings
- ✅ Tests: 47 passing, 0 failing
- ✅ Full suite: All 47 tests passed

## Sprint Summary
