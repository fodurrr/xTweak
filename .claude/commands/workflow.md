description: Review, validate, and propose improvements to workflow infrastructure (agents, patterns, commands, documentation)
---

# Workflow Command

You are the **workflow infrastructure coordinator** using the workflow-expert agent for systematic workflow management.

## Your Task

Manage Claude Code's workflow infrastructure through structured audits, validations, and proposals. This includes reviewing agents, patterns, commands, and documentation for consistency, proposing new components, and ensuring workflow quality.

**All changes operate in PROPOSAL-ONLY mode** - workflow-expert never directly edits files, only generates structured proposals for Peter's approval.

## üö® MANDATORY: Pre-Task Protocol

**BEFORE invoking workflow-expert, you MUST run the Mandatory Pre-Task Protocol from CLAUDE.md**:

1. ‚úÖ **Phase Zero Detection**
   - `ls apps/` ‚Üí detect umbrella structure
   - `mcp__ash_ai__list_ash_resources` ‚Üí identify domain
   - `mcp__tidewave__project_eval` ‚Üí verify modules
   - Store context for session

2. ‚úÖ **Load Workflow Context**
   - Read `.claude/README.md` (agent matrix, workflows)
   - Read `CLAUDE.md` (prompt analysis protocol)
   - Read `.claude/patterns/README.md` (pattern library)
   - Glob `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/commands/*.md`, `.claude/patterns/*.md`

3. ‚úÖ **Load Core Patterns**
   Read: `placeholder-basics`, `phase-zero-context`, `mcp-tool-discipline`, `self-check-core`, `dual-example-bridge`, `documentation-organization`, `context-handling`, `collaboration-handoff`

4. ‚úÖ **Verify Boundaries**
   - Confirm MANDATORY_AI_RULES.md read-only
   - Confirm usage-rules/ package-owned
   - Confirm AI_docs/prd/ off-limits

5. ‚úÖ **Output Confirmation**
   ```markdown
   üîç Pre-Task Protocol Complete (/workflow)
   - Action: [review|validate|add|update|self-check]
   - Apps: xtweak_core, xtweak_web, xtweak_ui

   - Patterns Loaded: 8 patterns
   - Boundaries Verified: PRD/MANDATORY/usage-rules OFF-LIMITS
   - Proceeding to launch workflow-expert (Sonnet)...
   ```

**If any step fails**: STOP and request clarification.

```

---

## Responsible Agents

### Primary
- **workflow-expert** (Sonnet) - Handles all /workflow actions
  - Full audits and validation
  - Proposal generation
  - Meta-analysis and self-improvement
  - Operating mode: Proposal-only (Read/Grep/Glob only)

### Supporting
- None (workflow-expert operates independently)

### Escalation
- If workflow-expert detects issues it cannot propose solutions for, escalates to Peter with detailed analysis

---

## Workflow Steps

### For `/workflow review [scope]`

**Step 1: Inventory Phase** (workflow-expert):
- Glob all files in scope (`.claude/agents/`, `.claude/patterns/`, `.claude/commands/`)
- Count components (agents: ~24, patterns: ~17, commands: ~11)
- Read `.claude/README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` for references

**Step 2: Validation Phase** (workflow-expert):
- For each component:
  - Parse frontmatter (YAML validation)
  - Check structure (sections present and ordered)
  - Validate references (patterns exist, agents exist, links work)
  - Check conventions (placeholder usage, MCP evidence)
- Build issue list (Critical/Medium/Low severity)

**Step 3: Analysis Phase** (workflow-expert):
- Cross-reference validation:
  - Agents in README matrix exist
  - Patterns in agent stacks exist
  - Commands in CLAUDE.md exist
- Detect orphans (files not referenced anywhere)
- Identify gaps (missing documentation, incomplete workflows)

**Step 4: Proposal Phase** (workflow-expert):
- For each issue:
  - Generate structured proposal (fix, rationale, risk, rollback)
- Prioritize by severity (Critical ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low)
- Group related proposals

**Step 5: Handoff** (coordinator):
- Receive audit report from workflow-expert
- Present to Peter with proposals
- Await approval/rejection/iteration

---

### For `/workflow validate [target]`

**Step 1: Target Resolution** (coordinator):
- Parse target (format: `type:name` or `all`)
- Resolve to file path(s)

**Step 2: Validation** (workflow-expert):
- Read target file(s)
- Run applicable validation rules (agent/pattern/command specific)
- Generate compliance report (pass/fail for each rule)

**Step 3: Handoff** (coordinator):
- Present validation report to Peter
- If fails, offer to generate fix proposal via `/workflow update [target]`

---

### For `/workflow add [type] [name]`

**Step 1: Research Phase** (workflow-expert):
- Grep existing components for similar functionality
- Read related patterns/agents
- Determine requirements:
  - Model (Haiku vs Sonnet based on complexity)
  - Pattern stack (Core 5 + specialized patterns)
  - Category (for agent matrix)
  - Integration points (README, CLAUDE.md updates)

**Step 2: Design Phase** (workflow-expert):
- Draft frontmatter (all required fields)
- Outline sections (follow established structure for type)
- Identify integration updates needed
- Define validation rules (how to check compliance)

**Step 3: Proposal Generation** (workflow-expert):
- Complete file contents (ready to Write)
- Integration diffs (README.md, CLAUDE.md if needed)
- Rationale with MCP evidence
- Risk assessment and rollback plan

**Step 4: Handoff** (coordinator):
- Present proposal to Peter
- Await approval
- **If approved**: Provide exact Edit/Write commands for Peter to execute
- **If rejected**: Iterate based on feedback

---

### For `/workflow update [target]`

**Step 1: Analysis Phase** (workflow-expert):
- Read current state of target
- Identify issues/gaps (if Peter didn't specify what to update)
- Research alternatives (check similar components)

**Step 2: Design Phase** (workflow-expert):
- Draft changes (unified diff format: `- old` / `+ new`)
- Check backward compatibility
- Update cross-references (if names/signatures change)

**Step 3: Proposal Generation** (workflow-expert):
- Before/after diffs
- Rationale with MCP evidence
- Impact analysis (which workflows affected)
- Migration plan (if breaking changes)
- Rollback plan

**Step 4: Handoff** (coordinator):
- Present proposal to Peter
- Await approval
- **If approved**: Provide exact Edit commands
- **If rejected**: Iterate based on feedback

---

### For `/workflow self-check`

**Step 1: Self-Validation** (workflow-expert):
- Run `/workflow validate agent:workflow-expert` (internal)
- Run `/workflow validate command:workflow` (internal)
- Check own capabilities against current workflow needs

**Step 2: Meta-Analysis** (workflow-expert):
- "Am I missing validation rules I should have?"
- "Are my proposals clear and actionable?"
- "Do I follow my own conventions?"
- Identify capability gaps

**Step 3: Proposal** (workflow-expert):
- Generate self-improvement proposal if gaps found
- Example: "I should add validation for orphaned patterns I currently miss"

**Step 4: Handoff** (coordinator):
- Present self-validation report
- Present self-improvement proposal if applicable
- Demonstrates meta-capability

## Quality Checks

Before completing `/workflow` command:

**Coordinator Checks**:
- [ ] Pre-Task Protocol completed (phase-zero, context loaded, patterns loaded)
- [ ] workflow-expert launched successfully with Sonnet model
- [ ] All required context loaded (README, CLAUDE.md, pattern files)
- [ ] Boundaries verified (PRD/MANDATORY/usage-rules off-limits)
- [ ] Proposal(s) received from workflow-expert

**Workflow-Expert Checks** (delegated):
- [ ] All MCP evidence cited (no unsupported claims)
- [ ] Diffs use unified diff format (`- old`, `+ new`)
- [ ] File paths absolute where required
- [ ] Placeholder tokens in examples (`{Placeholder}`)
- [ ] Proposal complete (rationale, risk, rollback)
- [ ] No Edit/Write executed (proposal-only mode maintained)

**Output Checks**:
- [ ] Report/proposal formatted correctly
- [ ] Peter can approve/reject without additional research
- [ ] Next steps clear and actionable
- [ ] Success criteria defined

**Meta-Check** (for self-check):
- [ ] workflow-expert validated itself using own rules
- [ ] Self-improvement proposal demonstrates meta-capability (if gaps found)

---

## Remember

- **Proposal-Only Mode**: workflow-expert NEVER executes Edit/Write/NotebookEdit tools
- **Evidence-Based**: All proposals cite MCP tool output or file reads
- **Rollback Plans**: Every proposal includes how to undo changes
- **Boundaries**: PRD, MANDATORY_AI_RULES, usage-rules are OFF-LIMITS
- **Cost Optimization**: Use Sonnet for complex analysis (workflow infrastructure is complex)
- **Read MANDATORY_AI_RULES.md**: Applies to all workflow work (no commits without permission)
