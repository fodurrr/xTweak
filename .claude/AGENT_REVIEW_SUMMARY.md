## Compliance Results

### ‚úÖ Fully Compliant (100% Score)

1. **agent-architect.md** - Exemplary implementation, serves as template
2. **code-reviewer.md** - Excellent Phase 0 and placeholder usage
3. **ash-resource-architect.md** - Comprehensive with multiple examples
4. **frontend-design-enforcer.md** - Frontend-specific Phase 0 pattern
5. **test-builder.md** - Testing-specific verification flow
6. **mcp-verify-first.md** - Models verification methodology

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Compliant (60-79% Score)

7. **security-reviewer.md** (60%) - Missing Phase 0 detection section
8. **code-review-implement.md** (70%) - Uses "MyApp" without clear placeholder context

### ‚ùå Non-Compliant (< 60% Score)

9. **cytoscape-expert.md** (30%) - **CRITICAL**: Extensive literal "MyApp" usage throughout

---

## Key Issues Identified

### Critical Issue: cytoscape-expert.md

**Problem**: Uses "MyApp" extensively as if it's the actual project name
- Lines 128-551 have hardcoded "MyApp.Graph", "MyAppWeb" references
- No Phase 0 detection
- No placeholder explanation
- Users will copy literally ‚Üí immediate failures

**Impact**: HIGH - Will cause compilation failures and confusion

**Resolution Required**: Complete refactoring needed

### Important Issue: security-reviewer.md

**Problem**: Missing Phase 0 detection before security review
- Uses "my_app_core" literally without detection
- Some "MyApp" usage in MCP examples without clarification

**Impact**: MEDIUM - May use wrong module names in security checks

**Resolution Required**: Add Phase 0 section + placeholder header

### Minor Issue: code-review-implement.md

**Problem**: "MyApp AI Specific Rules" section uses literal naming
- Not severe because it's in explanatory context
- Still needs placeholder awareness

**Impact**: LOW - Mostly affects understanding, not critical functionality

**Resolution Required**: Add Phase 0 + update examples to use placeholders

---

## Patterns Extracted

Four key patterns have been extracted to `.claude/patterns/`:

1. ‚úÖ **phase-0-detection-pattern.md**
   - Standard detection workflow
   - Variations for different agent types
   - Common mistakes to avoid

2. ‚úÖ **self-correction-checklist-pattern.md**
   - Verification before presenting results
   - Variations by agent type
   - Placeholder detection section

3. üìã **placeholder-explanation-header.md** (recommended)
   - Standard header explaining placeholder system
   - Examples of correct vs incorrect usage
   - Why placeholders prevent errors

4. üìã **dual-example-pattern.md** (recommended)
   - Shows generic pattern + concrete examples
   - Helps users understand adaptation process
   - Used in best-performing agents

---

## Action Plan

### Immediate (This Week)

**Priority 1: Fix Critical Issues**
1. Refactor `cytoscape-expert.md` completely
   - Add Phase 0 detection section
   - Replace ALL "MyApp" with `{YourApp}` placeholders
   - Add placeholder explanation header
   - Add self-correction checklist
   - Provide multiple concrete examples (Blog, Shop projects)
   - **Estimated**: 2-3 hours

**Priority 2: Update Partial Compliance**
2. Update `security-reviewer.md`
   - Add Phase 0 before "Review Methodology"
   - Add placeholder explanation header
   - Update MCP examples to use placeholders
   - Add self-correction checklist
   - **Estimated**: 1-2 hours

3. Update `code-review-implement.md`
   - Add Phase 0 as first workflow step
   - Update "MyApp AI Specific Rules" to use placeholders
   - Add placeholder explanation header
   - Add self-correction checklist
   - **Estimated**: 1 hour

### Short-term (This Month)

**Pattern Documentation**
4. Extract remaining patterns to `.claude/patterns/`:
   - `placeholder-explanation-header.md`
   - `dual-example-pattern.md`
   - **Estimated**: 30 minutes

5. Create pattern index: `.claude/patterns/README.md`
   - Document each pattern
   - Show when to use each
   - Link to exemplar agents
   - **Estimated**: 15 minutes

### Long-term (Next Quarter)

**Tooling and Prevention**
6. Create agent template: `.claude/patterns/agent-template.md`
   - Standardized structure
   - Built-in Phase 0 section
   - Placeholder header included
   - **Estimated**: 30 minutes

7. Add validation script: `.claude/scripts/validate-agent-compliance.sh`
   - Check for Phase 0 presence
   - Flag literal "MyApp" usage
   - Verify self-correction checklist
   - **Estimated**: 1 hour

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use

1. **Use agent-architect.md as template** when creating new agents
   - Has all compliance patterns built-in
   - Exemplary structure and organization

2. **Reference code-reviewer.md for Phase 0** implementation
   - Clear, concise detection workflow
   - Good examples of storing context

3. **Reference ash-resource-architect.md for dual examples**
   - Shows multiple project types (Blog, Shop, XTweak)
   - Demonstrates adaptation process well

### For Long-term Health

1. **Establish pattern review process**
   - Review new agents against extracted patterns
   - Update patterns as new best practices emerge

2. **Create agent design checklist**
   - Before merging new agents, verify compliance
   - Use validation tooling when available

3. **Document agent ecosystem**
   - Maintain agent dependency graph
   - Show which agents work well together
   - Identify gaps in coverage
