## üö® **MANDATORY RULES (TOP PRIORITY)**

* **TOP RULE**: üö´ **This section is permanent and must never be changed, deleted, or ignored.**
* **ALWAYS** read this memory first.
* **NEVER** assume feature availability or facts in any topic.
* **ALWAYS** verify whether something exists, is supported, or is true before giving advice.
* **ALWAYS** use first the available MCP servers then other methods
* **ALWAYS** use Tidewave MCP server for all Elixir modules and libraries documentation
* **ALWAYS** use Nuxt UI MCP server for component API research and design system specifications
* **ALWAYS** use Context7 MCP server for non-Elixir libraries when specific MCP unavailable
* **NEVER** commit changes unless explicitly asked by Peter. Do not add "commit changes" tasks to todo lists.
* **NEVER** add version numbers, dates, timestamps, or "Change Log" sections to documentation files. Git tracks all changes.
* **ALWAYS** follow documentation placement rules (see `.claude/patterns/documentation-organization.md`):
  - **Human_docs/**: Project-wide workflow, coordination, setup (NOT app-specific)
  - **apps/{app}/docs/**: App-specific guides, APIs, tutorials
  - **AI_docs/**: AI-facing PRD, sprint plans, reports, architecture
