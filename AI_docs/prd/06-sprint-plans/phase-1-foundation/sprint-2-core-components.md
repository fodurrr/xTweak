- [ ] No Credo violations (`mix credo --strict`)
- [ ] No compiler warnings (`mix compile --warnings-as-errors`)
- [ ] All tests passing (`mix test`)
  - [ ] Unit tests: 20+ new tests
  - [ ] Total tests: 73+ passing (53 existing + 20 new)
  - [ ] Coverage: >60%
- [ ] Playwright tests passing (5+ visual regression tests)
- [ ] Zero Dialyzer warnings (`mix dialyzer`)
- [ ] All components render correctly in showcase at `localhost:4000/showcase`
- [ ] Theme switching works (light/dark) on all components
- [ ] No migrations needed (no Ash resources in this sprint)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Slot Pattern Complexity (Card, Alert)
**Description**: HEEx slot patterns may have edge cases or rendering issues
**Mitigation**:
- Reference Sprint 1 Button implementation as pattern baseline
- Use `mcp-verify-first` to check existing slot usage in codebase
- Consult `/usage-rules/heex.md` for HEEx best practices
- Test slot combinations thoroughly (empty slots, multiple slots, nested content)

### Risk 2: Theme Integration Issues
**Description**: New components may not properly inherit theme colors
**Mitigation**:
- Follow established CSS variable patterns from Sprint 1
- Verify OKLCH color usage matches theme system
- Test both light and dark modes during development
- Use Playwright to catch visual regressions

### Risk 3: Test Coverage Target (>60%)
**Description**: May be challenging to reach 60% coverage with only 20 new tests
**Mitigation**:
- Prioritize high-value test cases (common use cases, edge cases)
- Use parameterized tests where applicable (test multiple variants in one test)
- Focus on critical paths (rendering, prop handling, slots)
- Track coverage incrementally with each component

### Risk 4: Playwright Test Setup
**Description**: Visual regression testing may require additional setup or tooling
**Mitigation**:
- Leverage existing Playwright MCP tools (already available)
- Start with basic screenshot tests, enhance iteratively
- Document baseline screenshot generation process
- Accept that initial baselines may need refinement

---

## Estimated Duration

**Total**: 5-7 developer-days

**Breakdown**:
- Task 1 (Badge): 0.5 days
- Task 2 (Avatar): 0.5 days
- Task 3 (Card): 1 day
- Task 4 (Alert): 1 day
- Task 5 (Divider): 0.5 days
- Task 6 (Playwright): 1.5 days
- Task 7 (Unit Tests): 1 day
- Task 8 (Showcase/Docs): 1 day

**Parallelization Opportunities**:
- Tasks 1-5 can be done sequentially but rapidly (3.5 days total)
- Tasks 6-7 can overlap partially (both testing-focused)
- Task 8 can begin as soon as showcase pages exist (Tasks 1-5 complete)

**Target Completion**: November 14, 2025 (end of Week 4)

### Framework Rules (Usage Rules)
Agents should consult these files from `/usage-rules/`:
- `heex.md` - HEEx template conventions (slot patterns critical for Card/Alert)
- `phoenix.md` - Phoenix/LiveView conventions
- `ash_phoenix.md` - Ash + Phoenix integration (minimal for this sprint)

### Usage Rules (Framework-Specific)
No additional usage rules required for this sprint (no Ash resources, pure UI components).

## Notes

### Lessons from Sprint 1
- Button implementation went smoothly, validates component patterns
- Theme system (OKLCH + CSS variables) works well
- Asset pipeline is performant (26KB bundle, under 30KB target)
- Showcase app at `localhost:4000/showcase` is effective for demos
- Quality gates (Credo, Dialyzer, tests) caught issues early

### Sprint 2 Focus Areas
- **Slot patterns**: Card and Alert will validate more complex slot usage
- **Accessibility**: Alert component requires proper ARIA attributes
- **Visual testing**: Playwright integration is new, document setup clearly
- **Test coverage**: Reaching >60% is a key milestone for Phase 1 completion

### Post-Sprint 2 (Phase 1 Gate)
After Sprint 2 completion, Phase 1 should be ready for stakeholder demo (M1.4):
- 5 components working in live showcase
- Theme system proven across multiple components
- Test coverage >60%
- All quality gates established and passing

**Phase 2** will expand to 20 additional components (form inputs, navigation, overlays, etc.).
